This project was created to efficiently measure the basic electrical parameters of a solar panel.

The aim of the project is to measure the voltage of the solar panel and use arduino
The aim of the project is to facilitate the measurement of parameters with low cost.

In the project, 16x2 LCD screen (I2C), Arduino UNO, solar panel and jumper cable were used.

The working principle of the project is to read the voltage of the solar panel from pin A0 and
then calculate the read value via Arduino and write it on the LCD screen.
